# [11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

#### Exemple 1

![question_11.jpg](images/question_11.jpg)

```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

#### Exemple 2

```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

#### Constraints

```
n == height.length
2 <= n <= 10^5
0 <= height[i] <= 10^4
```

### Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
      int max = 0;
      int ans = 0;
      for (int i = 0; i < height.size() - 1; i++){
        for (int j = 1; j < height.size(); j++){
          if (height[i] < height[j]){
            max = height[i] * (j-i);
            if (max > ans){
              ans = max;
            }
          } else {
            max = height[j] * (j-i);
            if (max > ans){
              ans = max;
            }
          }
        }
      }
      return ans;
    }
};
```
